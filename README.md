# Mann-E EMU dataset

_Expressive Media Universe_ or _EMU_ is a method of data gathering and training of image generation models which introduced by Meta. This method is simply like keeping the images high quality and the dataset small and in the other hand, spend more time training the model.

## Dataset

This dataset includes 1604 images which are generated by [Midjourney](https://midjourney.com) and hand-picked in terms of coherency and quality. Then, they have been processed for [Mann-E](https://mann-e.com). 
Also the prompts used in order to create the images are stored in `caption` files as well.
